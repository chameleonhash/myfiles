# <center> GitHub: Free Cloud Storage & File Hosting </center> 

### Free alternative, useful for smaller operation file hosting, cloud storage, and hyperlinking.
### Any file extension is supported, i.e. png, jpg, mp4, gif, exe, mp3, pdf (see size limits below).
### Easy to link, share and access for downloading or viewing any time.

 
## *Known Limitations as of 2023:* 

* If you attempt to add a file that is larger than 50 MB, you will receive a warning, however the file will still push to the repository. 
* If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB. 
* When uploading files to a repository via the command line, GitHub allows single uploads as large as 100 MB.
* Maximum file size per repository is 100 GB (store up to 100 GB of your files for free, in one repository, others can be opened).
* For more information, see ["Adding a File to a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository).

### To link or embed a file from your hosted repository in an HTML document, or to download, simply append 
### `?raw=true` to the file's URL, this appended URL is the downloadable/embeddable version of the file's address.

### For instance, if the web address to your file is: 

-- `https://github.com/chameleonhash/hostedfiles/blob/main/assets/pics/gifs/Trippy-Cat.gif`

-- add `?raw=true` to the end of that URL like so: 

-- `https://github.com/chameleonhash/hostedfiles/blob/main/assets/pics/gifs/Trippy-Cat.gif?raw=true`

-- With the new URL, you can now directly link the file, embed it on another webpage, or even directly download it by simply pasting the appended URL into any browser address bar.


#### Below this line, a gif has been embedded using the technique described above. The embedded file is stored within this repo. By using the appropriate HTML markdown syntax, including the designated URL of the file, and appending `?raw=true` to the URL, the "Trippy-Cat" gif has been embedded in this markdown README file, and should be visible below. The "Trippy-Cat" can serve as a proof of work example for this repository, with respect to its functionality, regarding the procedure of linking/downloading/embedding files. As long as the gif below is visible, the process of appending `?raw=true' to the hosted file's URL is a working method.
